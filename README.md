## Overview

The automobile industry is a critical sector in the global economy, with growing interest in personal vehicles for transportation. Choosing the right car can be challenging due to factors like price, spare parts availability, cylinder volume, and more. Our goal is to simplify this decision-making process by employing predictive algorithms to analyze customer preferences and forecast purchasing likelihood.

## Problem Statement

### Existing System
- Relied on **Logistic Regression**, which assumes linearity between variables.
- Found limitations in handling non-linear data, leading to suboptimal predictions.

**Disadvantages:**
- Inability to manage non-linear decision surfaces.
- Linearly separable data is rare in real-world scenarios.

## Proposed System

We implemented and analyzed several supervised machine learning algorithms to predict car purchases more accurately:
- **Naive Bayes**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Random Forest**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**

### Key Features:
- Data sourced from social media platforms like Twitter, blog posts, and news comments.
- Dataset split into 70% for training and 30% for testing.
- Evaluation metrics:
  - **Accuracy**
  - **Precision**
  - **Recall**
  - **F1 Score**
  - **Execution Time**

**Results:**  
The **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** algorithm demonstrated the highest accuracy, achieving **86.7% prediction accuracy**.
